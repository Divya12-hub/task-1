In this task, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing on a raw dataset to make it consistent and ready for analysis. I started by identifying and handling missing values, and then removed duplicate records to 
ensure data accuracy. Next, I standardized text values such as gender, country names, and customer names for uniformity. I converted date columns into a consistent dd-mm-yyyy format and renamed column headers into a 
clean, lowercase, and underscore-separated format. I also checked and fixed data types â€” converting age into numeric values, purchase amount into float, and join date into proper datetime. Finally, I saved the cleaned 
dataset, which is now well-structured and suitable for further analysis and visualization.
